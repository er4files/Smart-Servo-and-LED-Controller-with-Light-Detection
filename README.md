# Smart-Servo-and-LED-Controller-with-Light-Detection
The "Smart Servo and LED Controller with Light Detection" project is an innovative system that uses an ESP32 microcontroller to control a servo motor and an LED based on ambient light levels and user commands. This project demonstrates how to integrate various components and sensors to create a responsive and interactive setup.
